h3. Install

Make assets folder into your document root. 

<pre>
cd /path/to/document/root
mkdir assets
chmod a+w assets
</pre>

Copy plugin files to _frog/plugins/assets/_ folder.

<pre>
cd frog/plugins/
git clone git://github.com/tuupola/frog_assets.git assets
</pre>

You also need Peter Gassners excellent "Image Resize":http://github.com/naehrstoff/image_resize/ plugin and my "jQuery":http://github.com/tuupola/frog_jquery and "jQuery UI":http://github.com/tuupola/frog_jquery_ui plugins.

<pre>
cd frog/plugins/
git clone git://github.com/naehrstoff/image_resize.git image_resize
</pre>

<pre>
cd frog/plugins/
git clone git://github.com/tuupola/frog_jquery.git jquery
</pre>    

<pre>
cd frog/plugins/
git clone git://github.com/tuupola/frog_jquery_ui.git jquery_ui
</pre>    


Go to admin and enable Assets and Image Resize, jQuery and jQuery UI plugins. 

If you are using Page not found plugin disable and then re-enable it. This makes it run as last plugin on the page and fixes compatibility issue with Image Resize

Now you are set to go.
